* Change the name of the author to yours
* Write `plot(cars)` in the second R code chunk below
* Knit HTML

Please indicate how much time you spent on this assignment: 


```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
